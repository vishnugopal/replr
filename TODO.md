# TODO

## Planned

[ ] Support another stack: Python?
[ ] Have a `replr prune` command to delete all docker images created by replr

## Done

[✓] Publish as gem
[✓] Ensure that multiple gems work fine
[✓] Find a way to suppress Docker run output, it's too verbose. Maybe through -d flag & attach later?
